# Team Profile Generator
This Node.js app required me to create several classes and sub classes to represent members of an engineering team. The program then receives input from the user to create a team of people with different roles. Finally an HTML page is generated placing each member of the team along with their specific information in their own card.

## App Breakdown
This command line interface program asks the user for the following information about their engineering team's manager: their name, their ID, their email address, and their office phone number. The manager is then pushed to an array of employees. After that, the program asks the user to add an additional employee to the team. The user must select whether the new employee is an engineer or an intern. Engineers are asked the same questions as the manager minus the phone number, and instead they are asked for their Github user name. Interns are asked the same questions as the manager minus the phone number, and instead they are asked which school they attended. After each additional employee is added, the user will be given the choice if they wish to add another. The program continues adding employees until the user answers no.

This program is not web-based, so there is no live version. Here is a link to a video of the program in action: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jf_59xess7G9uGafA21Hr3MxNyJvvMnc/view
